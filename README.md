# Chez GObject Introspection

## About

Generate static Chez scheme bindings for libraries that support GObject Introspection.

Generated bindings will include a Makefile to compile and install to a library directory.

## Status

Manual bindings have been written for libgirepostiory.

Next up, write the program to convert typelib info to Chez scheme libraries and Makefile.
