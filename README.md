Chez support for GObject Introspection.

https://gi.readthedocs.io/en/latest/

Installed typelibs:
/usr/lib/girepository-1.0

GObject based libraries generate a binary typelib definition file.

Language bindings parse typelib (maybe via libgirepository) to access underlying gobject based shared library.
